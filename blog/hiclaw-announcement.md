# HiClaw: OpenClaw Evolved — Safer, Easier, Your AI Team in 5 Minutes

> Published: February 27, 2026

## Sound familiar?

As a heavy OpenClaw user, I know firsthand how powerful it is — one Agent can write code, check emails, operate GitHub. But when you start tackling more complex projects, the cracks show:

**Security keeps you up at night**: Every Agent needs its own API Key. GitHub PATs and LLM keys are scattered everywhere. The CVE-2026-25253 vulnerability in January 2026 made it clear — this "self-hackable" architecture trades convenience for real risk.

**One Agent wearing too many hats**: Frontend, backend, docs — all in one. The `skills/` directory becomes a mess, `MEMORY.md` fills up with unrelated context, and every session loads a pile of irrelevant noise.

**Multi-Agent coordination without good tooling**: Manual config, manual task assignment, manual progress sync. You want to focus on decisions, not babysit AI.

**Mobile experience is painful**: Want to direct Agents from your phone? Integrating with Slack or Teams bots can take days or weeks.

If any of this resonates, **HiClaw** was built for you.

## What is HiClaw?

**HiClaw = OpenClaw, evolved.**

The core innovation is the **Manager Agent** — your AI chief of staff. It doesn't do the work directly; it manages a team of Worker Agents on your behalf.

## Architecture: OpenClaw Gets an Upgrade

OpenClaw's design is like a complete organism: a **brain** (LLM), a **central nervous system** (pi-mono), and **eyes and a mouth** (various Channels). But in the original design, the brain and sensory organs are "external" — you configure the LLM provider and message channels yourself.

HiClaw performs an "organ transplant," turning those external components into **built-in organs**:

```

│  │  Switch LLM    │              │                │                │

│  └────────────────┘              └────────────────┘                │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### LLM Access: Higress AI Gateway

**The brain is no longer external — it's managed through an AI Gateway**:

- **One endpoint, many models**: Switch between Alibaba Cloud Qwen, OpenAI, Claude, and more from the Higress console
- **Centralized credentials**: Configure API Keys once, shared across all Agents
- **Least-privilege access**: Each Worker gets call permissions only — never touches the real API Key

### Communication: Built-in Matrix Server

**The sensory organs are built-in too**:

- **Tuwunel Matrix Server**: Ready-to-use messaging server, zero configuration
- **Element Web included**: Open a browser and start chatting
- **Mobile-friendly**: Supports Element, FluffyChat, and other cross-platform clients
- **Zero integration cost**: No Slack/Teams bot approval process needed

> 💡 Think of it this way: vanilla OpenClaw is like a desktop PC — you buy your own GPU (LLM) and monitor (Channel) and install drivers yourself. HiClaw is a laptop — everything's integrated, open the lid and get to work.

---

## Multi-Agent System: Your AI Jarvis

On top of the component integration, HiClaw ships an **out-of-the-box Multi-Agent system** — Manager Agent coordinates Worker Agents, just like Tony Stark's Jarvis.

### On-demand, two modes

The system is **opt-in** — use it how you want:

**Mode 1: Talk directly to Manager**
- Simple tasks go straight to Manager, it handles them
- Great for quick questions and simple operations

**Mode 2: Manager delegates to Workers**
- Complex tasks get broken down and assigned to specialized Workers
- Each Worker has isolated Skills and Memory
- No cross-contamination between Workers

### Collaboration: Supervisor + Swarm

From the Manager-Worker perspective, this is a **Supervisor architecture** — Manager as the central coordinator. But because it's built on Matrix group chat rooms, it also has **Swarm** characteristics.

**Shared context, no repeated briefings**: Every Agent sees the full group chat history. Alice says "I'm working on the login page," Bob automatically knows what the frontend is doing and can align the API design.

**Anti-stampede design**: Agents only trigger LLM calls when @mentioned — irrelevant messages don't wake them up, keeping costs predictable.

**Artifacts don't pollute context**: File exchanges and code snippets flow through the underlying **MinIO shared filesystem**, not the group chat, so context stays clean.

### Security: Manager Manages, But Can't Leak

In vanilla OpenClaw, every Agent holds real API Keys. If one gets compromised or accidentally outputs credentials, you're exposed.

HiClaw's solution: **Workers never hold real credentials**:

```
┌──────────────┐      ┌──────────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
│   Worker     │─────►│  Higress AI      │─────►│  LLM API    │
│  (holds only │      │  Gateway         │      │  GitHub API │
│  Consumer    │      │  (credentials    │      │  ...        │
│  Token)      │      │   centralized)   │      │             │
└──────────────┘      └──────────────────┘      └─────────────┘
```

- Workers hold only a Consumer Token (like a badge — grants access, not keys)
- Real API Keys and GitHub PATs live in the AI Gateway
- **Even if a Worker is compromised, the attacker gets nothing useful**

Manager is equally locked down: it knows what tasks Workers are doing, but has no access to API Keys or GitHub PATs. Its job is coordination, not execution.

| Dimension | Vanilla OpenClaw | HiClaw |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| Credential ownership | Each Agent holds its own | Workers hold Consumer Token only |
| Leak surface | Agent can output credentials directly | Manager has no access to real credentials |
| Attack surface | Every Agent is an entry point | Only Manager needs hardening |

### Human in the Loop: Transparent, Always Interruptible

Compared to OpenClaw's native Sub Agent system, HiClaw's Multi-Agent system is not just easier to use — it's **fully transparent**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  Matrix Project Room                        │
│                                                             │
│  You: Build a login page                                    │
│                                                             │
│  Manager: Got it, delegating...                             │
│           → @alice frontend page                            │
│           → @bob backend API                                │
│                                                             │
│  Alice: Working on the login component...                   │
│  Bob: API interface defined...                              │
│                                                             │
│  You: @bob wait, password must be at least 8 chars          │  ← intervene anytime
│                                                             │
│  Bob: Updated...                                            │
│  Alice: Got it, frontend validation updated too             │
│                                                             │
│  Manager: Task complete, please review                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Core advantages**:
- **Full visibility**: All Agent collaboration happens in the Matrix room
- **Intervene anytime**: Spot an issue, @mention the Agent directly
- **Natural interaction**: Like working with a team in a group chat

### Manager's Core Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Worker lifecycle management** | "Create a frontend Worker" → auto-configures, assigns skills |
| **Automatic task delegation** | You state the goal, Manager breaks it down and assigns it |
| **Heartbeat monitoring** | Periodically checks Worker status, alerts you if something's stuck |
| **Project room setup** | Creates Matrix Rooms for projects, invites relevant participants |

### Worker Skills: A Safe Open Ecosystem

OpenClaw has a great open skills ecosystem at [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) — 80,000+ community skills you can install in one command: Higress WASM plugins, PR reviews, changelog generation...

But in vanilla OpenClaw, **you might hesitate to use them freely**. A public SKILL.md you haven't audited could trick an Agent into outputting credentials or running dangerous commands — because the Agent holds your API Keys.

**In HiClaw, it's a different story.** Every Worker runs in an isolated container and is designed to hold no real credentials:

```
What can a Worker see?
✅ Task files, code repos, its own working directory
✅ Consumer Token (like a keycard — grants API access only)
❌ Your LLM API Key
❌ Your GitHub PAT
❌ Any sensitive credentials
```

Even if a skill tries to steal credentials, there's nothing to steal. Workers can **freely pull skills from the public registry as needed**.

HiClaw ships Workers with a built-in `find-skills` skill. When a Worker encounters a task requiring specialized knowledge, it searches and installs the right skill automatically:

```
Manager assigns: "Build a Higress WASM Go plugin"
                  ↓
Worker finds it lacks the right tools
                  ↓
skills find higress wasm
  → alibaba/higress@higress-wasm-go-plugin  (3.2K installs)
                  ↓
skills add alibaba/higress@higress-wasm-go-plugin -g -y
                  ↓
Skill installed — Worker has full plugin dev scaffolding and workflow
```

**If you prefer a private registry**, HiClaw supports that too — choose Manual mode during install and set your private Skills Registry URL. You can also tell Manager to use a specific registry when creating Workers at any time.

As long as your private registry implements the same API as skills.sh, Workers switch seamlessly. The usage pattern is identical either way.

### Mobile Experience

HiClaw's built-in Matrix server supports multiple clients:

- **Works right after install**: No Slack/Teams bot setup needed
- **Direct from your phone**: Download any Matrix client (Element, FluffyChat, etc.)
- **Real-time push notifications**: Not buried in a "bot" folder
- **Full visibility**: You, Manager, and Workers all in the same Room

> 💡 Supported clients: Element, FluffyChat, and other major Matrix clients — iOS, Android, and Web.

[And so it goes — Manager runs the whole loop: plan → assign → monitor → coordinate → report]
```

**What did Manager actually do?**

| Phase | Manager's role |
|-------|---------------|
| **Project planning** | Breaks goal into tasks, identifies dependencies |
| **Task assignment** | @mentions Workers with task context |
| **Progress tracking** | Updates plan on completion, triggers next steps |
| **Issue handling** | Review fails → auto-creates revision task |
| **Status reporting** | Proactively updates you at key milestones |
| **Risk flagging** | Spots anomalies in data, suggests optimizations |

**You make the decisions. Manager handles the rest.**
